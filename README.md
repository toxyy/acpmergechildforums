# toxyy ACP Merge Child Forums v1.0.0

[Topic on phpBB.com](#TBA)

## Requirements

The latest event used in this extension was added in phpBB 3.1.2.
I use twig, which is 3.2+, so presumably the requirements are:

phpBB 3.2+ & PHP 7.1.3+


I have only tested on 3.3.7 with PHP 8.1, but no new syntax was used either.
